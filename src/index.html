        Besides rail and bus extensions, the plan includes:

        <ul>
          <li> <b>Housing</b>
          A $20 million fund for low-interest revolving loans would be set aside for housing developers who set low rents. Four-fifths of surplus land must be reserved for affordable units after Sound Transit construction teams are finished using it. Another $30 million would be spent to study or plan dense, transit-oriented development.

          <li> <b>Payments to the state</b>
          A 2015 law requires $518 million from ST3 tax revenue be paid to the state general fund for education or social services.

          <li> <b>Fleet-replacement fund</b>
          About $781 million would be set aside through 2041 to replace trains, tracks and station equipment to prevent big system breakdowns.

          <li> <b>Near-term bus projects</b>
          To keep ST Express, Pierce Transit, Community Transit, and RapidRide moving, bus lanes would be added, including on highway shoulders. Also promised are more service hours, a Sammamish park-and-ride, and money for a Madison Street bus corridor in Seattle.

          <li> <b>Planning for ST4</b>
          A total $187 million to plan a fourth round of projects and study future lines, including White Center, Burien, Renton, north Everett, Orting, Tacoma Mall, a crosstown Ballard-UW-Highway 520 line, and north Lake Washington.

        <div class="versus">
          <div class="pro view">
            <h4>The Pros</h4>

            <ul>
              <li>The region needs more transportation capacity for today’s trips and for 800,000 people expected to move here by 2040.
              <li>Taxpayers in places such as Everett, Ballard, West Seattle, Federal Way, Kirkland and Issaquah have been paying for others’ light rail for years. It’s their turn to get stations.
              <li>Frequent four-car trains can move 16,000 people an hour, while a general highway lane carries 2,000 vehicles — and there’s no room to expand freeways.
              <li>Light rail “lets you escape congestion, reduces climate pollution, and improves access and affordability for all.” The full network would serve 695,000 daily trips.
              <li>Projects would create tens of thousands of skilled construction jobs.
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="con view">
            <h4>The cons</h4>

            <ul>
              <li> Measure would triple Sound Transit’s car-tab tax — bringing the total for ST3 plus earlier packages to $1,000 a year for “middle-class families.”
              <li> ST3 wouldn’t reduce congestion. Rail serves a fraction of regional trips, and “just moves people who already ride buses onto trains.”
              <li> Bus rapid-transit lanes could be established sooner at far less cost.
              <li> For the first time, Sound Transit seeks a property tax, which could make it tougher for the Legislature to increase education funding.
              <li> Self-driving cars, electric vehicles, and ride-service companies such as Uber and Lyft would make light rail obsolete, before the rail extensions are finished.

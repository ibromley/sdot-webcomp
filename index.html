        <h2>Roadmap</h2>
        <p>The demands on Seattleâ€™s transportation system have grown dramatically in recent years. Meanwhile, the system is aging. SDOT must balance infrastructure expansion, preservation, and maintenance by aligning Asset Management practices with service delivery strategies. This must occur within the limits of available resources to ensure that we strategically manage the transportation system for years to come.</p></p>

        <h2>Bicycle and Pedestrian System</h2>
        <p>The Bicycle and Pedestrian System asset class serves pedestrians and bicyclists and encourages walking and bicycling for transportation and recreation.</p>
        
        <h3>Accessible Seattle For Everyone</h3>
        
        
        <p>SDOTâ€™s Curb Ramp and Accessible Route Planner, located at http://seattle.gov/transportation/, is intended to help pedestrians plan routes using the location, condition, and slope of curb ramps and sidewalks.</p>

        <h2>Bridges &amp; Structures</h2>
        <p>The Bridges and Structures asset class consists of the transportation structures that are associated with the street network and a few one-of-a-kind roadway structures (talk about one of them here)</p>
        
        <h3>Did you know?</h3>
        
        
        <p>You might know this as the Seattle Underground! Following the Great Seattle Fire of 1889, streets in the Pioneer Square area were raised during reconstruction, creating the Seattle Underground as we know it today.</p>
        
      </div>
      
      <div class="layer" data-layer="Bridge_struct">
          
        <h2>Why Maintenance is Important</h2>
        <p>Since a bridge can potentially have a very long useful life, effective management requires maintenance and replacement of major components of the bridge on a recurring cycle, rather than replacement of the entire structure</p>

      <div class="layer" data-layer="Channelization">
          
            <div id="channelization" class="anchor"></div>
          
        <h2>Channelization</h2>
        <p>The Channelization asset class consists of pavement markings, other than crosswalks, and delineator posts that define usage of the city streets and direct the flow of traffic. Painted lane line channelization is not long-lived and we generally do not consider it in the same category of infrastructure such as bridges, pavement or signals which last decades. Channelization markings generally require annual maintenance.</p>
        
        
      </div>
      
      <div class="layer" data-layer="Channelization">
          
        <h2>Why Maintenance is Important</h2>
        <p>Lines and markings typically have a life-spane of 3 - 5 years before they need to be replaved. SDOT is currently experimenting with alternative lane markings such as green bike boxes and red bus lanes that will reduce the cost and frequency of maintenance.</p>

        <h2>Intelligent Transportation System</h2>
        <p>Intelligent Transportation System, or ITS, is a new asset class for the 2015 Status & Condition Report. It combines Intelligent Transportation Signs and Traffic Signal Assemblies in order to recognize the system as a network of interdependent data-driven assets. The ITS class includes all of the assets that are either electrically- or solar powered and comprise the system that regulates, controls, communicates and manages the flow of traffic.</p>
        
        
      </div>
      
      <div class="layer" data-layer="ITS">
          
        <h2>Why Maintenance is Important</h2>
        <p>The ITS asset class includes assets with life-spans from 8 years to 50+, however since assets in this class are newer a good maintenance strategy can expand these life-spans and reduce maintenance/replacement costs.</p>
        
        
      </div>
      
      <div class="layer" data-layer="Parking">
          
        <h2>Parking Payment Devices</h2>
        <p>Parking payment devices collect fees for parking on public property or in the Right-of-Way (ROW). The City of Seattle uses on-street payment devices to manage parking in highly utilized areas to create the turnover needed to support a vibrant city. The Parking Operations group in the Transit and Mobility Division manages parking payment devices.</p>
        
        
      </div>
      
      <div class="layer" data-layer="Parking">
          
        <h2>Why Maintenance is Important</h2>
        <p>Paid parking plays a vital role in ensuring popular areas such as downtown have parking avaliable. The city began replacing single spot meters in 2004, finishing in 2013. The next update to the Parking Payment infrastructure will come in 2022-2023.</p>

        <h2>Pavement</h2>
        <p>The Pavement System asset class consists of the surface, base, sub-base, and subgrade of Seattleâ€™s street network.</p>
        
        
      </div>
      
      <div class="layer" data-layer="Pavement">
          
            <div id="pavement" class="anchor"></div>
          
        <h2>Lane miles</h2>
        <p>The total arterial and non-arterial pavement network in Seattle consists of 3,954 12-foot-wide lane miles. We base this figure on a comprehensive pavement management assessment conducted in 2013-2014.</p>
        
        
      </div>
      
      <div class="layer" data-layer="Pavement">
          
        <h2>Why Maintenance is Important</h2>
        <p>As a roadway becomes more degraded and in need of maintenance, the cost to the city of each car passing over that road increases dramatically. Factor in that evidence suggests that the increasing use of heavy vehicles on Seattleâ€™s arterials is accelerating a decline in pavement quality on arterials, and it becomes clear that maintaining our roads can save a ton of money.</p>
        
        
      </div>
      
      <div class="layer" data-layer="Pavement">
          
        <h2>What About My Street?</h2>
        <p>Delayed repair on non-arterial pavement has similar impacts as arterial pavement although new 2014-2015 condition information on non-arterial pavement show that non-arterial pavement quality declines at a much slower rate than arterial pavement quality, most likely due to vastly less heavy vehicle traffic.</p>

        <h2>Real Property</h2>
        <p>SDOT owns buildings that support transportation services and buildings indirectly acquired through the ROW acquisition process for capital projects. When acquiring parcels for street and multi- purpose ROW usage, a parcel may have a building present, which is purchased as part of the transaction.</p>

        <h2>Urban Forest at Work</h2>
        <p>According to extensive industry research, street trees provide many benefits to the urban environment and are a critical part of the transportation system: From a transportation perspective, street trees serve as traffic calming devices along arterial corridors, and also serve as a buffer between pedestrian and vehicular traffic. A tree-lined street is more attractive to bicyclists and pedestrians and promotes these modes of transportation.</p>
